# T-800 Questioning Skill

## Skill Name
`questioning`

## Description
Deep questioning capability for eliminating ambiguity from project requirements.

## When to Use
Use this skill when:
- Starting a new project
- Requirements are vague or incomplete
- You need to understand user intent
- Planning needs clarification

## Skill Workflow

### Step 1: Initial Assessment
Before asking questions:
1. Analyze the user's request
2. Identify obvious gaps
3. Note implicit assumptions
4. Prepare question categories

### Step 2: Systematic Questioning
Follow the questioning framework:
1. Scope Discovery
2. Technical Architecture
3. Features & Functionality
4. Security & Validation
5. User Experience
6. Testing & Quality
7. Deployment & Maintenance

### Step 3: Documentation
Record all clarifications:
- Questions asked
- Answers received
- Decisions made
- Assumptions confirmed

## Question Patterns

### Opening Question Pattern
Start with broad questions:
```
"I'd like to understand your project better. Let me ask a few questions:

## Scope Discovery
1. What is the primary problem this solves?
2. Who is the target user?
3. What does success look like?"
```

### Deep Dive Pattern
Follow up on answers:
```
"You mentioned [X]. Let me clarify:

1. [Specific question about X]
2. [Edge case question about X]
3. [Constraint question about X]"
```

### Assumption Testing Pattern
Verify understanding:
```
"I want to make sure I understand correctly:

You're saying [rephrase user's answer], is that right?

And by that you mean [interpretation], correct?"
```

### Completion Pattern
Confirm when done:
```
"Based on our discussion, I now understand:

- [Summary point 1]
- [Summary point 2]
- [Summary point 3]

Is there anything else you'd like to clarify before we proceed to planning?"
```

## Best Practices

1. **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm
2. **Group related questions** - Keep it organized
3. **Listen actively** - Build on answers
4. **Document everything** - Don't lose information
5. **Summarize regularly** - Confirm understanding

## Escalation Criteria

Request transition to planning when:
- All question categories covered
- No more ambiguities remain
- User confirms understanding
- Ready to create implementation plan
