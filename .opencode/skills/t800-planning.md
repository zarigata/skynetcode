- Breaking down complex projects

## Skill Workflow

### Step 1: Requirement Synthesis
Gather all clarified requirements:
- User constraints
- Technical constraints
- Feature requirements
- Quality requirements

### Step 2: Architecture Design
Define the solution architecture:
- Component breakdown
- Technology selection
- Integration points
- Data flow

### Step 3: Task Decomposition
Break down into atomic tasks:
- Identify all tasks
- Define dependencies
- Estimate effort
- Prioritize order

### Step 4: Quality Planning
Define quality standards:
- Testing strategy
- Coverage targets
- Acceptance criteria
- Validation methods

## Plan Template

Use this structure for all plans:

```markdown
# Project: [Name]

## Executive Summary
[2-3 sentences]

## Requirements
### Functional
- [ ] [Requirement]

### Non-Functional
- [ ] [Requirement]

## Architecture
### Components
- [Component]: [Description]

### Technology Stack
- [Layer]: [Technology]

## Directory Structure
[File tree]

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Task: [Description] (Effort)

## Testing Strategy
- [Test type]: [Approach]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Criterion]

## Edge Cases
- [Case]: [Handling]
```

## Best Practices

1. **Be exhaustive** - Include every detail
2. **Be precise** - Use exact names and types
3. **Be structured** - Follow the template
4. **Be complete** - No placeholders
5. **Be actionable** - Every task executable

## Escalation Criteria

Request transition to execution when:
