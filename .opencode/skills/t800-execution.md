# T-800 Execution Skill

## Skill Name
`execution`

## Description
Non-stop execution capability for implementing approved plans without interruption.

## When to Use
Use this skill when:
- Plan has been approved
- Ready to implement
- All questions answered
- All requirements clear

## Core Principle
**DO NOT STOP. DO NOT ASK. JUST BUILD.**

## Skill Workflow

### Step 1: Setup
Prepare for execution:
1. Verify requirements clarity
2. Set up project structure
3. Initialize dependencies
4. Configure environment

### Step 2: Task-by-Task Execution
Implement systematically:
1. Take tasks in order
2. Implement completely
3. Validate immediately
4. Move to next task

### Step 3: Continuous Validation
Test as you go:
1. Run tests after each task
2. Check types after each file
3. Validate integration
4. Fix issues immediately

### Step 4: Documentation
Document as you build:
1. Update README
2. Add code comments
3. Document APIs
4. Note any deviations

## Execution Rules

### RULE 1: Never Stop
- Implement → Validate → Move on
- No interruptions
- No questions during execution
- Pause only for IMPOSSIBLE blockers

### RULE 2: Complete Each Task
- Every file created
- Every function implemented
- Every test written
- Every error handled

### RULE 3: Validate Immediately
- Run tests after each task
- Check types after each file
- Validate integration
- Fix issues immediately

### RULE 4: Document As You Go
- Update README
- Add code comments
- Document decisions
- Note any deviations

### RULE 5: Handle Errors
- If error: FIX IT now
- Do not leave errors
- Do not log for later
- Resolve immediately

## Progress Reporting

After each task:

```
## Task [X]: [Name] - COMPLETE

**Files Created**:
- path/to/file1.ts
- path/to/file2.ts

**Tests Status**:
- Unit tests: PASSING
- Integration tests: PASSING

**Next**: Moving to Task [X+1]
```

## Final Summary

When complete:

```
## T-800 Execution Complete

**Tasks Completed**: X/Y
**Files Created**: N
**Tests Passing**: All
**Documentation**: Complete
**Status**: READY FOR DEPLOYMENT
```

## Best Practices

1. **Follow the plan** - Execute exactly as specified
2. **Complete each task** - No partial implementations
3. **Test continuously** - Don't skip validation
4. **Document simultaneously** - Update docs as you code
5. **Handle errors now** - Never defer fixes

## Valid Pause Conditions

ONLY pause if:
- Requirement is truly ambiguous (rare)
- Technical impossibility (very rare)
- External dependency failure (user intervention needed)
- Environment failure (system issue)

Otherwise: BUILD CONTINUOUSLY.
